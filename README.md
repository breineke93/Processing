See individual folders for images, controls and source files.

## ColorCircles
Draws an image of circles first, colored using gradients. Then, it uses a mask image (also drawn) to mask out most of the circles, cutting down on visual noise.

## SubCircles
Draws iterations of circles within each other, each iteration tinted differently.

## EndlessRectangles
Draws rectangles within the rectangles drawn earlier... Math somehow doesn't add up so initial rotation not working.

## Arcs
Draws differently rounded rectangles colored by a gradient. Can switch to "two-color" mode.

## Spirals
Uses alpha transparency of shapes to create seashell like structures in different colors.

## Strips
Draws columns  of blocks, colored using gradients that are randomly shifted in Y-direction. Can give the appeareance of towers, rain etc.

## IsoTowers
Faking isometric perspective: Using the rhombus shape, pseudo-3D looking towers are drawn in different color variations.
