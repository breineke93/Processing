# Processing
## ColorCircles
Draws an image of circles first, colored using gradients. Then, it uses a mask image (also drawn) to mask out most of the circles, cutting down on visual noise.
### Controls
* Change size of mask circles: Left (smaller) and right (larger)
* Change size of background circles: Up (larger) and down (smaller)
* Move mask circles: w (up) and s (down)
* Change amount of rows for mask circles: a (less) and d (more)

### To-Do:
* Use better colors(?) (use harmonic colors)
* Make it look artistic...
* Clean up code
* Better center the mask circles when changing the amount of rows
