# New sketches for 2024
## Floaters
Draws line segments in different colors (interpolated). I used this sketch to try drawing a frame with a title over the actual generated image.
## Moiré
Draws clusters of circles along an arc or a line, with varying rotation and offset to generate a moiré effect.
